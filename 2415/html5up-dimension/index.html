								<h1>Feeding Ontario's Future - Food Bank Usage Mapping</h1>
								<p>Food insecurity is a pressing issue globally, with significant implications for health and well-being.
									In Ontario, Canada, food insecurity affects many individuals and families, leading to reliance on
									food bank services for basic needs. To address this challenge, Feed Ontario aims to develop an
									interactive web map displaying food bank usage data across provincial electoral ridings. This
									project builds upon previous efforts, leveraging Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
									technology to visualize food bank usage per capita and demographic information. The project
									intends to give the public and policymakers insights into regional differences in food insecurity
									through data pre-processing, visualization, spatial analysis, and customization techniques. This
									report outlines the data acquisition, preprocessing, spatial analysis, and visualization methods
									employed to analyze food insecurity and food bank usage across Ontario. Feed Ontario's postal
									code data was geocoded and aggregated to the provincial riding level to protect privacy.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/fo2.gif" alt="" ></span>
								<p>In Ontario, food insecurity is a severe problem since many people and families rely on food bank services to meet their basic needs. Effective policymaking and resource allocation depend on an understanding of the demographic characteristics that underlie the regional distribution of food bank use. In the project, we aim to develop an interactive web map displaying the latest food bank usage data in Ontario for public access, organized according to provincial electoral riding boundaries. The goal is to focus on the regional variations in food insecurity in Ontario by displaying the amount of food banks used per person.</p>

								<h2 class="major">METHODOLOGY</h2>
								<h3>PROJECT WORKFLOW</h3>
									<p>The project adopted the agile project management method. Agile development was an iterative software development process that prioritized short term outputs that were modified over time in response to client feedback. Over the project course, a substantial quantity of client input was obtained, enabling the team to adjust to changes and involve the client’s requirements in the decision-making process.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/wf1.jpg" alt="" ></span>
								<h3>Data Pre-Processing </h3>
									<p>Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates, allowing them to
										be positioned on a map. This process was accomplished using ArcGIS Pro. To achieve this, a
										reference layer with a 6-digit postal code shape file across Ontario, obtained from Scholars
										Geoportal, was provided as a reference layer to create the locator.
										The "LDU" role in the Create Locator geo-processing tool required mandatory FSA (Forward
										Sortation Area) and LDU (Local Delivery Unit) fields. This necessitated splitting the 6-digit postal
										code field into the first 3 digits (FSA) and the last 3 digits (LDU). The Add Fields and Calculate
										Fields tools were used, with the sample expression “!POSTALCODE![:3]” to extract the first three
										digits of the postal codes, creating two new fields: FSA and LDU.
										The criteria were imported into ArcGIS Pro as five separate tables. The Geocode Addresses tool
										utilized the previously created locator and geocoded the five criteria into x-y coordinates based on
										the postal codes field. This process successfully converted the tables into point feature classes.</p>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/data.jpg" alt="" ></span>
										 
								<p>After importing the data in ArcGIS Pro, the projection was adjusted to Lambert Conformal Conic
									projection. To facilitate a more accurate analysis of food insecurity through Multi Decision Criteria Analysis, we partitioned the Ontario province into
									Northern and Southern Ontario. This division was essential because the population was not
									uniformly distributed in the two regions, particularly with the southern section being highly dense.
									The northern part of Ontario comprised 9 electoral ridings, while the southern part comprised 112
									federal ridings.</p> 
	
												
								<h3>Spatial Analysis of AHP MCDA for Food Insecurity</h3>
									<p>The purpose of this spatial analysis was to identify the area prone to hunger and food insecurity.
										After importing the factors in ArcGIS Pro, we first divided the Study area into northern and
										southern regions. Secondly, we created raster surface of all five factors using polygon to raster
										tool. Subsequently, we categorized the data into a 1 – 9 Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) schema
										with 1 being the least suitable and 9 being the most suitable conditions, for both the Northern and
										Southern Ontario (figure 5). By using a natural break method, the criteria were divided into nine
										classes, and the results were rounded up. These suitability ratings were coded to reflect the relative
										suitability within each criterion. Steps involve in the spatial analysis are polygon to raster tool, reclassify tool, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) pairwise comparison, Weighted Overlay, calculate field.</p>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/data.jpg" alt="" ></span>
										<p>Our statistical analysis focused on identifying the electoral ridings with the highest and lowest per
											capita food bank use in 2021 and 2023 among a total of 124 ridings. Additionally, we identified
											the ridings with the total population and the highest and lowest population in 2021 and 2023. We
											also identified the highest and lowest of the Ontario Works Percentages received in 124 electoral
											ridings for the years 2021 and 2023.</p>
										<p>We calculated for 124 Ontario electoral ridings the average food bank use per capita and the
											Ontario Works of 2021 and 2023. Additionally, we computed the percentage increases and
											decreases of the average Ontario Works percentage over the two years from 2021 to 2023.
											Furthermore, we computed the population growth percentage from 2021 to 2023.</p>
										 
								<h3>Web Development and Enterprise Technology</h3>
									<p>Due to our client's lack of an ArcGIS Pro account, we utilized our own account instead.
										Subsequently, we will proceed to transfer all the files to our client's ArcGIS account using ArcGIS
										Online Assistant.
										Upon conducting a spatial analysis of food bank utilization per capita in the years 2021 and 2023
										using ArcGIS Pro, Initially, we transferred the web layer from ArcGIS Pro to our Fleming ArcGIS
										Online account.</p>
